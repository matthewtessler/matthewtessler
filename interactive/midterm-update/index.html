					<h1>Midterm Project Update - SimonKeys</h1>
					<h3><a href="../midterm-project/index.html">link to the work in progress</a></h3>
					<p>SimonKeys project is coming along well, I've set up all of the easy-to-medium difficulty code. I have coding logic for play-pause mode, selecting the difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and explanatory text in play and pause modes. I also have the scaffolding set up for play mode. This has three internal modes: play, listen, and build. Build is when SK is building a list of keys to play back, play is when it is playing them back, and listen is for when it is listening for user input. Each of the modes will behave differently. Build will build a stack of random keys, play will play the tone back and display the key on the canvas, and listen will listen for key input and play the corresponding tones back. I think what I've left is the difficult part. I have to build the stack of keys, listen for user input in the correct order, and choose tones. I know how I want points logic to work (add numberOfPossibleKeys*numberOfKeysPlayedBack to score). It isn't a very graphically intensive –or exciting– game right now, but once I have the logic complete I'll experiment with the graphics and colors more.</p>
