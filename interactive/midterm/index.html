          <h1>Midterm Project Proposal: <b>SimonKeys</b></h1>
          <p>
            <b>SimonKeys</b> is a game based off the electronic game of memory skill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">Simon</a>, which involved a physical interface of four buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow) and pressing them in a specified order. The object of the game was to see how many times the player could repeat back the colors before they couldn’t memorize them any longer. Linked is a <a href="https://www.henrybear.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/full/tgtgho16189758c2dc4d3537b.jpg">picture</a> of the game, as well as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4">video</a> of the game being played. Players were assisted in memorizing the color sequence by the auditory assist of each button having a preassigned tone.
            <br><br>
            My idea for <b>SimonKeys</b> is for this same sequence-based memorization with the assist of tones, except instead of having four colored-buttons, the keyboard will be used. There will be three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Easy will have four keys from which to choose, Medium will have 12 keys from which to choose, and Hard will have all 26 lettered keys from which to choose. Each key will have a tone. 
            <br><br>
            The sequence of the game will go like this:
            <ol>
              <li>Choose a level of difficult</li>
              <li>Sequence is played back (e.g. A, Y, U, K)</li>
              <li>
                User attempts to relay the sequence back
                <ul>
                  <li>If they fail, the game starts over and they can choose a new level of difficulty</li>
                  <li>If they succeed, the game continues with one more key to memorize</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            The user can pause or restart at any time and choose a new level of difficulty. There will be a points system. 
            <br><br>
            I’m choosing to pursue this project because it’s a simple game that tests a very basic skill, memorization, with a fun twist of sound. I think it will be pretty challenging to code, as I’ll have to use some sort of stack or other way of storing the sequence of characters inputted to confirm if the user got it right. It will also involve the tonal functionality of P5, as well as an element of randomization. I think there are also different features I can add on if I have more time or want to make it more exciting. I can make experiment with graphics and tones a lot. It should be fun.
