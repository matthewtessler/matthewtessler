		<h2>Overview of Game</h2>
		<hr>
		<p><b>Cops and Robbers</b> is a very basic game based off of collision logic and movement logic. The idea of the game is for the user (the Robber) to avoid the Cop (the computer) for as long as possible. The Cop chases the Robber down for 10 seconds, and if the Robber can escape for 10 seconds they win. The Cop speeds up as time goes on, and the user can also set a speed of the Cop at the start of the game with the HTML text input. My inspiration for the game was the demo with the ellipse that follows the mouse around, as well as the game "Tag."</p>
		<h2>Documentation of Physical Controllers</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>There are many images and photos from the Makey Makey class group work. For the experimentation (make your own physical controllers) part we made stomp controllers, where stepping on pieces of aluminum foil worked as left and right controls. Those images and videos are available via this Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FP-Kky7bqymlAzxrldDLTj43-MDovX7o?usp=sharing">link</a>.</p>
