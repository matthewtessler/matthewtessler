		<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Matthew Tessler, and I'm an aspiring software engineer with dreams of working at cool companies that use software to craft solutions that make the world a better place. Right now I'm a junior at NYU, majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> and minoring in <b>Math</b> and <b>Music</b>. I work as a Python tutor, create fun projects with the skills I've developed over the past two years at school, and try to immerse myself in the tech communities at NYU and NYC as much as I can. The world is an inspiring place, and I'm trying to make it a bit better using programming. I'd love to work with you.
